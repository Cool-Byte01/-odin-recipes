    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      You might feel like making lasagna in a pressure cooker is crazy. Don't
      you need an oven for those crunchy edges? To make sure the meat is cooked
      through? How can anyone make lasagna without baking it? Well, trust us -
      this one is well worth making. If you have a 6- or 7-inch springform pan
      and you kept the trivet that came with your Instant Pot, you can make a
      delicious layered lasagna pie in 30 minutes. And if you want to make it
      ahead, you can prep the lasagna, put it in the freezer, then put it right
      into the Instant Pot for an easy dinner.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>
        1 (6 ounce) package no-boil lasagna noodles, broken into large pieces
      </li>
      <li>1 Â½ cups marinara sauce, or to taste</li>
      <li>2 cups fresh spinach</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package soft goat cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Turn on a multi-cooker (such as Instant Pot) and the select Saute
        function. Heat olive oil; add ground beef and salt. Cook, breaking it
        into clumps with a spatula, until thoroughly browned, about 6 minutes.
        Transfer beef to a bowl. Wash the pot and return it to the machine.
      </li>
      <li>Pour 1 1/2 cup water into the pot. Set the metal trivet inside.</li>
      <li>
        Arrange lasagna pieces over the bottom of a 6-inch springform pan. Ladle
        1/3 the tomato sauce on top; add 1/3 of the cooked beef and 1/3 of the
        fresh spinach. Dollop 1/2 the mozzarella cheese on top. Repeat layers
        using 1/2 the goat cheese. Repeat once more, finishing with remaining
        mozzarella and goat cheese on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tent the top of the lasagna loosely with aluminum foil. Lower it gently
        onto the trivet. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according
        to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 20 minutes. Allow 10 to 15
        minutes for pressure to build. Release pressure using the
        natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to
        40 minutes. Unlock and remove lid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's
        broiler.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the springform pan carefully to a baking sheet. Broil until
        cheese on top is lightly browned and bubbling, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
